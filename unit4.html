    <p> In your own words describe the benefits of creating functions in your code?

Also, functions make code more reusable, functions reduce redundancy by allowing programmers to call functions at different places in a program. Functions allow for abstraction, providing the ability to take specific actions and separate them into reusable parts.</p>
